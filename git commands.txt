 1.git init
this will convert your working directry into a github directory/repositry and we will found a .git file inside our working  folder/directory/repositry

 2.git add .             
this will add all the new files or changes in our working direcry but it will not actually all the changes untill we make a commit

 3.git commit -m "any message for new addition/update/any change"            
this will really do all changes that we've done

 4.git status ==> optional:  it will tell us the status of changed/update files in repositry..

 5.git remote add origin <copylink here>
this will link our local repositry to the remote repositry of github

 6.git push origin main/master        
this will know your credentials so put them and our code is pushed to 
remote github repositry

note:now if we make any changes we can again repeat all steps from 
>> 2.git add . << to onwards.........that's it.
