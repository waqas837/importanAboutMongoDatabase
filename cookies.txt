how to send cookies from server to client and then client to server?

follow steps
=>from express server install a package; npm i cookie-parser and then app.use(cookieparser());
res.cookie(name,value)
it will automatic set the cookies on front end

=>from front end side npm i cookies js
=>read/delete and send cookies
=>then use cookies.get("name", {path:"/",subdomain:"") && cookies.remove("name")


//one more thing to avoid errors
=>axios.defaults.withCredentials = true (frontend) on everypage

//backend
cors({
origin:["http:localhost/any"],
credentials:true
}) 
//by settingout these then with every request cookies will be send automtic to the server...
